# What is this?
- This is a production website built for a small business using the MERN stack
- I built this as a favor for a awesome friend which doubled as a requirement to obtain my web development certification from the UofM Coding Bootcamp
- The website includes almost all functionality that a product owner would want included in a production ready website
- The learning curve on this was substantial as I implented API's and many other react libraries to make this all work together.

## Installation
- No installation required as this is a production website. However if you would like to use this repository for reference, after cloning this to your local machine, run the `npm install` command at the root of the directory followed by `npm run develop` which will start the server

## Usage
- You can use this website and book reservations with the owner at (https://pawsnclaws-petcare.herokuapp.com/)
