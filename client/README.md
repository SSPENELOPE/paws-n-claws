Our Goal: Deploy a working website where a customer can sign up for a dog walking service and book an appointment. This will allow the client to manage multiple appointments at the same time.

how to install: open integrated terminal, enter npm i. this will automatically launch the website.

We ran into numerous challenges. some of the challenges that we ran into was attempting to set up email links, before deciding to set up a contact form with 2 different forms. One for tech support, another for the actual dog walker.
